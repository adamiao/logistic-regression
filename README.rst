Logistic Regression
===================
The purpose of this project is to implement a *multinomial logistic regression* algorithm from scratch to get a better
understanding of this numerical technique. This project is still under development.

How to Use this Tool
====================

My suggestion is to install this package within a python environment of your choice (on my personal projects I use the
`conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_ package manager). This will allow you to integrate it with other projects
you may be working on.

If this is the route you decide to take, please read the `installation documentation <installation-documentation>`_.

If you're interested only in the heart of the algorithm, you may just use the code within `logistic_regression.py <logistic-regression-py>`_
and make the necessary adjustments.

How to Use the CLI
==================

Under construction!

There is a lot of interesting stuff out there regarding this topic! For a surprisingly nice presentation, check out the
information on `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression>`_.

However, the resource I found to be the most useful (not only for this project), was the following book:
`Learning From Data: A Short Course. Y. S. Abu-Mostafa, M. Magdon-Ismail, and H-T. Lin, AMLbook.com, March 2012 <http://www.amlbook.com/>`_
